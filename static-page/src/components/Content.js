        Cinderella is a classic fairy tale about a kind and gentle young woman
        who, despite being mistreated by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters,
        finds happiness through magic and perseverance. After her father’s
        death, Cinderella is forced into servitude in her own home, enduring
        cruelty while maintaining hope for a better life. When the royal palace
        announces a grand ball where the prince will choose a bride,
        Cinderella's stepfamily prevents her from attending. However, her fairy
        godmother appears, transforming her rags into a beautiful gown and glass
        slippers, allowing her to go to the ball under the condition that she
        must return before midnight. At the ball, Cinderella captures the
        prince’s heart, but as the clock strikes twelve, she flees, leaving
        behind one glass slipper. The prince searches the kingdom for the owner
        of the slipper, and despite her stepmother’s efforts to keep her hidden,
        Cinderella tries on the shoe, proving her identity. She and the prince
        are reunited, and they marry, bringing an end to her hardships.
